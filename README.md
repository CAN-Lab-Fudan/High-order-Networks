# Higher-order-Networks

## 1. Higher-order Epidemic Spreading in Simplicial Networks
### 1.1 Background Information
Epidemics do not only spread through simple pairwise contacts (like families or colleagues), but also through group interactions such as classrooms, workplaces, or communities. These higher-order structures can be modeled using simplicial complexes, which capture multi-node interactions beyond traditional network edges.

In this work, we propose a **higher-order** epidemic model that:
* Ensures node state consistency within simplices (groups).
* Captures the coexistence of interacting groups and their dynamic effects.
* Provides a solvable network model capable of showing bistable regions and epidemic thresholds.
